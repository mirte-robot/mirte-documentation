Specify Hardware
================

This step in only needed in case you are not using the MIRTE PCB (or followed the 
breadboard instructions). For other MCUs (or other wiring of the Raspberry Pi Pico) the software still
needs to know which pin is connected to what kind of hardware. This can be done in two ways.


From the Web Interface
----------------------

On the webinterface this can be done by removing and adding the peripherals in order
to match your robot hardware:

        :alt: Save settings


From the Terminal
-----------------

The configuration to map the pins to sensortypes is done in `/usr/local/src/mirte/mirte-ros-packages/mirte_telemetrix/config/mirte_user_config.yaml <https://github.com/mirte-robot/mirte-ros-packages/blob/main/mirte_telemetrix/config/mirte_user_config.yaml>`_. 
This file consists of multiple sections needed for MIRTE to know which pins to control. 
The default settings are the MIRTE PCB. Below we will got though all sections (of the 
Raspberry Pi Pico on a breadboard).

.. code-block:: yaml

   device:
     mirte:
       type: breadboard
       board: pico                     # [pico, blackpill_f103c8, nanoatmega328]
       max_frequency: 50

Each config needs to state which type of device is is controlling. In this case we have 
one device called 'mirte' of type 'breadboard' with a 'pico' on it. The sampling frequency
is set to 50Hz, so every 2ms new sensor data will come in. Please note that your 
max_frequency might depend on the number of sensors you have connected. The more sensors
you connect, the lower the sampling frequency can get. If your sampling frequency is too
high you will notice a delay in the data.
